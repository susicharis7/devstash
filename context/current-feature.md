# Current Feature: Add PRO Badge to Sidebar

Mark the Pro-only item types (`file`, `image`) in the sidebar Types list with a
clean, subtle, uppercase **PRO** badge that has a soft glow animation.
See `@context/features/09-add-pro-badge-sidebar.md`.

## Status

In Progress

## Goals

- Install the ShadCN `badge` component and use it for the PRO marker
- Flag Pro-only types in the sidebar data: add `isPro` to `SidebarItemType`
  (`src/lib/db/items.ts`), true for the `file` and `image` system types
- Render the badge as the `trailing` slot for Pro types in `SidebarContent`'s
  Types section, replacing the count for those rows
- Badge styling: uppercase `PRO`, small/subtle, tinted to the app accent, readable
  in dark mode (primary target) and light mode
- Add a subtle glow animation to the badge via `@keyframes` in
  `src/app/globals.css` (Tailwind v4 CSS config — no `tailwind.config.*`)
- Keep the existing sidebar layout, spacing, and row alignment unchanged
- `npm run build` passes with no new lint errors

## Notes

- Pro-only types come from `project-overview.md`: `file` and `image` are Pro; the
  other five system types are Free.
- `SidebarContent.tsx` is the only consumer of `SidebarItemType`; it's a
  `"use client"` component fed props from `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`.
- The raw DB `ItemType.name` is singular (`file`, `image`) while the view model
  exposes `name: "Files"` / `slug: "files"` — derive `isPro` from the raw name
  before that transform.
- Gating is display-only: during development all users can access everything, so
  the badge must not disable the link or change navigation.
- Tailwind v4: theme/animation config lives in `@theme` / plain CSS in
  `globals.css`. Do not create a `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for the glow animation.
- No comments in code, per `coding-standards.md`.

## History
<!-- Keep this updated. Earliest to latest. -->

- **2026-07-22 — Initial Next.js setup.** Scaffolded with Create Next App
  (Next.js 16.2.10, React 19.2.4, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4). Removed default
  boilerplate assets, added project context docs (`project-overview`,
  `coding-standards`, `ai-interaction`, `current-feature`) and CLAUDE.md guidance.
  Connected to `github.com/susicharis7/devstash` and pushed to `main` (`413a9a2`).
- **2026-07-22 — Dashboard UI Phase 1.** Initialized ShadCN UI (button, input),
  enabled dark mode by default, and added the `/dashboard` route with a sidebar +
  top bar shell. Top bar search and action buttons are display-only; sidebar and
  main area are placeholders for phases 2 and 3. Merged to `main` via
  `feature/dashboard-phase-1`.
- **2026-07-22 — Dashboard UI Phase 2.** Built the functional sidebar: collapsible
  on desktop (top-bar drawer icon toggles it) and an overlay drawer on mobile.
  Added a collapsible Types section (links to `/items/{slug}` with color-coded
  icons + counts), a Collections section split into Favorites and All Collections,
  and a bottom user-avatar area with a settings button. Added a `SidebarProvider`
  context plus a `useIsMobile` hook and a centralized item-type icon map; installed
  ShadCN `avatar`, `separator`, `scroll-area`, `sheet`, `tooltip`. Data comes from
  `@src/lib/mock-data.ts`. Merged to `main` via `feature/dashboard-phase-2`.
- **2026-07-22 — Dashboard UI Phase 3.** Built the main content area: 4 stats
  cards (items, collections, favorite items, favorite collections), a recent
  Collections grid (top 6 by recency, color-coded by dominant type), a Pinned
  items section, and the 10 most recent items. Added display-only `StatCard`,
  `CollectionCard`, and reusable `ItemRow` components plus an `itemTypesById`
  lookup in mock data. Completes the 3-phase dashboard UI layout. Merged to
  `main` via `feature/dashboard-phase-3`.
- **2026-07-24 — Neon Postgres connected.** Ran Neon's agent onboarding; using the
  existing `devstash` project with `development` and `production` branches. Wired
  per-environment env files (`.env.development` / `.env.production`, both gitignored)
  so `next dev` targets the dev branch and `build`/`start` the prod branch;
  `DATABASE_URL` is pooled (runtime), `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` is direct (migrations).
  No Neon Auth / serverless driver installed (using NextAuth + Prisma).
- **2026-07-24 — Prisma + Neon setup.** Added Prisma 7 (`prisma-client` generator →
  `src/generated/prisma`, gitignored) with the `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter
  (pg over the pooled URL); config in `prisma.config.ts` loads env via `@next/env`
  and runs migrations against the unpooled URL. Wrote the initial schema from
  `project-overview.md` plus NextAuth models (`Account`, `Session`,
  `VerificationToken`), with indexes and cascade deletes, and applied the `init`
  migration to the dev branch. Client singleton at `@/lib/prisma`. Merged to `main`
  via `feature/prisma-neon-setup`.
- **2026-07-24 — Seed data.** Added `prisma/seed.ts` (`npm run db:seed`) that
  populates the database with a demo user (`demo@devstash.io`, bcryptjs 12-round
  hash), the 7 system item types, and 5 collections with 18 items. Prompts `y`/`n`
  to start and requires 3 confirmations before overriding existing data; targets
  the development branch by default. Added a `password String?` field to `User`
  (migration `add_user_password`) and the `bcryptjs` dependency. Merged to `main`
  via `feature/seed-data`.
- **2026-07-24 — Dashboard collections from the database.** Added
  `src/lib/db/collections.ts` (`getRecentCollections`, `getDashboardStats`) and
  switched the dashboard main area to fetch the 6 most recent collections and the
  stat cards from Neon via Prisma (demo user, ordered by `updatedAt`). Card border
  color now derives from the most-used content type, with icons for all types
  present. `CollectionCard` takes a DB view model; the page is an async server
  component using `connection()` to render at request time (so `next build` never
  touches the DB). Pinned/Recent items and the sidebar still use mock data
  (deferred). Merged to `main` via `feature/dashboard-collections-db`.
- **2026-07-24 — Dashboard items from the database.** Added `src/lib/db/items.ts`
  (`getPinnedItems`, `getRecentItems`) and switched the dashboard Pinned and Recent
  sections to real DB data via Prisma; the Pinned section is hidden when there are
  no pinned items. `ItemRow` now takes a DB view model (type-derived icon/border,
  tags, pin/favorite markers, date) and no longer uses mock data. Enriched
  `prisma/seed.ts` to mark a few items pinned/favorite, add 15 tags, and favorite
  two collections (also clears tags on override). The dashboard main area is now
  fully DB-backed; only the sidebar still uses mock data. Merged to `main` via
  `feature/dashboard-items`.
- **2026-07-24 — Stats & sidebar from the database.** Made the sidebar DB-backed:
  added `getSidebarItemTypes` (system types, per-type counts scoped to the demo
  user, canonical order, display label + plural slug) to `src/lib/db/items.ts` and
  `getSidebarCollections` (favorites + recents, each with a dominant-type accent
  color) to `src/lib/db/collections.ts`, extracting a shared `rankCollectionTypes`
  helper. The dashboard layout is now an async server component (`connection()`)
  that fetches both datasets and passes them through `Sidebar` to the client
  `SidebarContent`. Sidebar Types link to `/items/[slug]` with real counts;
  favorite collections keep the star and recents show a colored circle by dominant
  type; added a "View all collections" link to `/collections`. Only `currentUser`
  still comes from mock data (auth is a later feature). Merged to `main` via
  `feature/stats-sidebar-db`.
